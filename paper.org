* Title
* Abstract
* Introduction
* P1
** Introduce the problem domain single-trode
** High-level overview of the final model
** Intuitive, iterative process
Example of an iteration?
* P2
** Move to multiple streams: Need to develop a parallelism story
** STM let us write it naturally
*** Let us think in small parts without needing to keep track of the whole
* P3
** Performance issues with naive approach
*** Memory usage
*** Low framerate
*** Thread starvation?
** Diagnosis:
*** Growing amount of heap space taken by specific values without bound
*** Suspected laziness issues
** Minimum machine performance required to avoid stuttering as GC catches up
** Still slow degredation of performance over time
** Not sure exactly what was happening or why the fixes worked
* Conclusion
